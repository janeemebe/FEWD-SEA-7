      	<h1 class="rtg-h1title">Follow a migration process</h1>
        <p>Your migration should ideally follow a process to make the transition from Windows Server 2003/R2 to the cloud as smooth as possible. That process will include discovering, assessing, and targeting workloads and software before choosing the right migration plan.</p>
        <div class="slides">
          <div class="slides_container">        
            <div id="section3_block1">
              <h2 class="rtg-h2title">Discover</h2>
                <p>The first step is to discover and catalog all of the software and workloads running on Windows Server 2003/R2. There are several self-service tools that can help with this process, such as the Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) Toolkit, a free tool that helps you collect and organize system-wide information from a single, networked computer. Other third-party discovery offerings include Dell ChangeBASE, Lakeside Software SysTrack, JumpStart for Windows Server 2003 from Microsoft Services, and a number of other options from system integrators and Microsoft partner service providers.</p>
            </div>
          <div id="section3_block2">
            <h2 class="rtg-h2title">Assess</h2>
            <p>Once you have a catalog, you will need to assess what’s in it. This means categorizing and analyzing your cataloged applications and workloads based on type, criticality, complexity, and risk. After completing your assessment, you can prioritize workloads and applications for migration. This helps identify issues and opportunities.</p>
          </div>
            <div id="section3_block3">
             <h2 class="rtg-h2title">Target</h2>
              <p>Choose a migration destination for each application and workload. Available options include Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Azure, Cloud OS Network, and Office 365. Different workloads and applications will logically lead to certain targets. Others could offer the possibility of migration to one or more of these destinations. The choice will be driven by factors such as speed, ease of migration, cost, and desired functionality.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="section3_block4">
              <h2 class="rtg-h2title">Migrate</h2>
              <p>Choosing the right migration plan may require some additional analysis and assistance. Several vendors offer do-it-yourself tools to assist in the decision-making process and in the migration itself, including Dell ChangeBASE, Citrix AppDNA, AppZero, and JumpStart for Windows Server 2003. Other migration services are also available through system integrators, including several Microsoft partners.</p>
